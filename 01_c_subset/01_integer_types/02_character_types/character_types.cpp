/** @brief char - type for character representation
 * It has the same representation and alignment as signed char or unsigned char
 * the choice of signed or unsigned for a char is implementation-defined (char might be signed or unsigned)
 * but it is distinct type
 * There were "exotic" char sizes over history, sometimes need to me noticed on legacy systems
 * CDC 6x00 char==6bit
 * Unisys ClearPath/OS2200 char==9bit
 * PDP-6/10, IBM 70xx char==9bit
 * PDP-8 char==12bit
 * PDP-11 char==16bit
 * TexasInstruments C54/62/64x char==16bit
 * Windows CE char==16bit
 * Motorola dsp56k char==24bit
 * The exact number being recorded in macro CHAR_BIT
