Functions

* Function pointer types could be defined with typedef or using
* Explicit inline makes sense if
   - its definition is in *.cpp file
   - in template functions (std::max)
* inline could be cancelled by the recursion, cycle, virtual methos or taking function address
* std lib has function pointers callback: new_handler
* If you put the inline function's definition into a .cpp file, and if it is called from some other .cpp file, 
  you'll get an "unresolved external" error from the linker
